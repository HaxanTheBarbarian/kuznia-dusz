# Original ideas

- I'd like to have a mobile application that would allow me to give informations to players about
  - other characters
  - items
  - powers
  - it should be able to work offline
  - it to fully sync with most recent version of a scenario (per scenario not all of them)


# Use cases

## Game creator use cases

- See a list of my games
- Create/edit a game
- Create/edit a character
    - name
    - description
    - relations
- create/edit item
    - name
    - description
    - image
- Add character to a game
- import character description from outside (i.e. a word file, confluence article, etc.)
- send updates to game masters and characters about changes in scenario

## Game master use cases

- See assigned games
- synchronise a game to a device
- read short description of a game
- list characters in a game
- search a character in a game
- list items in a game
- search an item in a game
- get update messages from game creators
## Player use cases

- see my games
- read description of my assigned characters
- read known knowledge of my character ( other characters, iteam etc.)
